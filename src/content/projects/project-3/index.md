This is a proyect that I realize in the process of training for my TFG too, and I think it may be useful for someone to start learning how this things are about.

In addition, this was my first Machine Learning proyect, in which I learned the most. 

So let's start explaining the structure of the repo and how the program works.

## ¿Questions?

### ¿Where I found the dataset?
I found the **dataset** on -> https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/

This is public University -> https://ethz.ch/en.html

On this **dataset** we can find 101 different ypes of food with 1000 images per categorie, this is a big **dataset** (5G).

### ¿How it works?
The principal program is **all based on python** and it is contained on a ``.ipnyb`` file which is a `jupiter notebook` format that can improve the understanding of the program, and its escalability.

On the `.ipnyb` file there is a explication of each part of the process.

### ¿What dependecies do the program use?
For this kind of proyects I always work with `python virtual envs` because it always has a problem with a specific dependecy or something like that. It is basically to prevent future conflicts of dependecies.

So in the repository I let a ``requirements.txt`` where you only need to do:
```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

and that's all, I hope would be usefull :) !!
